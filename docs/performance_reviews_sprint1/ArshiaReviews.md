## General Comments
- In the next sprint, dialogue is essential. Last-minute problems can be avoided by establishing earlier deadlines for pull requests and code reviews. Organizing extra sessions outside of class hours could enhance collaboration and result in higher-quality code. We are grateful for our skillful usage of the issue tracker and Kanban board.
