## General Comments
 - A significant improvement in comnication compared to the last sprint. 
 - We had an adequate amount of online meetings in this sprint.
 - During our online meetings, screen streaming made all the team member  to focus on a single module at a time which really made us to understand each others modules. Infact that really motivated us to work on each others modules as well.
 - we had a good discipline in finishing up tasks.
 - This is my first group project working with team mates, talking to the other groups i can proudly say i was in the best group in the class.
 - The work load of each module is uneven.
 - I am certain that each team members put thier best effort in the project
 - I am also confident that my team members would agree that this CS course took most of thier academic time.
 - Team mates are flexible in changing the team meeting times.
 - I am open to work in many other projects with this team beyond this course.
