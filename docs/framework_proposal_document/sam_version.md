# Database

The database is heavily coupled and would require extensive refactoring to modularize it. The profile part of the database, where user profiles are stored, is the only part that would easily be decoupled from the project. This means that storing, loading, and destruction of user profiles would be virtually identical other than whatever other extra attributes a developer would want associated with a user profile. In addition to this, the login verification and updating of both username and passowrd would also remain the same.

The game state part of the database would have to be mostly refactored. If the new game is a two player turn based game, such as checkers and chess, then only some parts need to be refactored. This would be how the game is actually stored, as well as the attributes that are tictactoe specific such as ustate which says what player has won what grid and the next grid which says which says which grid must be played next. The attributes such as the two username IDs, the outcome, and next player would could remain the same to accommodate a turn based two player game as mentioned above. If a turn based game with greater than two players was to be implemented, additional username IDs could be added as attributes to be stored alongside the two username IDs to allow this.
