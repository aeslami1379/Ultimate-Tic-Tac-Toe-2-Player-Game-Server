## Team Member: Tyler
### Assigned Task: User and Session Management
 - Tyler has been a valuable team member, consistently attending meetings and responding promptly to messages. While his code is well-documented, it can be complex at times. He's adept at using project management tools like the kanban board. However, more communication is needed. Despite facing challenges, he has shown resilience and skill in completing his tasks and has proven to be a reliable team member.

## Team Member: Sam
### Assigned Task: Database 
 - During the first sprint, Sam stepped up as our team lead and has been very reliable in the role. His coding is consistently clean and easy to follow, and he readily offers thorough explanations when teammates have questions. Actively engaged in meetings and discussions, Sam effectively identifies and resolves issues using our project management tools. Overall, he's a great team player who provides valuable support to colleagues. However, enhancing communication could further strengthen team cohesion and collaboration.

## Team Member: Ashfaq
### Assigned Task: App Logic
 - Ashfaq has been a valuable team member, consistently offering effective solutions to encountered problems. While he was present for most meetings, communication sometimes posed a challenge. There were instances where I struggled to grasp the implementation or scope of certain methods he provided. Nonetheless, Ashfaq demonstrated proficiency in utilizing the kanban board and issue tracker.

## Team Member: Arshia
### Assigned Task: Server API
 - Arshia has demonstrated strong dedication as a team member, particularly evident in his perseverance while encountering challenges with the server API. Although he faced difficulties, he invested considerable effort into resolving them. While Arshia was present for most meetings and effectively utilized the kanban board and issue tracker, I believe seeking assistance with the server API earlier in the sprint would have been beneficial.

## General Comments
 - The team effectively utilized GitHub, the kanban board, and the issue tracker throughout the project. However, we identified the need for improved communication methods. Towards the end of the sprint, we incorporated Discord for code reviews, which proved successful. Moving forward into sprint 2, we plan to continue utilizing Discord for communication. Each team member is demonstrating a sincere commitment to contributing, a positive aspect not previously observed in group projects. Working with this team has been enjoyable, and we anticipate building upon our successes in sprint 2 while learning from any missteps encountered in sprint 1.
