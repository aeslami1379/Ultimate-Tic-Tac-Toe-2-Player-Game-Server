## ServerAPI   

---
The proposal for modularizing the ServerAPI framework aims to enhance flexibility and scalability, catering to diverse game types. Initially, the profile management component, being relatively decoupled, will undergo refinement to seamlessly accommodate additional user attributes while maintaining operational consistency. Simultaneously, adjustments to the game state management module will be made to align with the intricacies of different games. For instance, transitioning from tic-tac-toe to chess within the ServerAPI framework would require significant updates to the game state module. This involves revising storage mechanisms to handle complex board configurations and piece movements specific to chess, as well as incorporating attributes like castling availability and en passant possibilities. Furthermore, API endpoints and request/response formats would need updating to reflect the rules and mechanics of chess, including defining new endpoints for actions like moving chess pieces and handling special moves unique to chess. Additionally, validation logic within the API would be adjusted to enforce the rules of chess, ensuring that only valid moves are accepted and that the game progresses accordingly.

Moreover, to support turn-based games with multiple players, the API will be bolstered with flexible attribute management and scalable data structures, facilitating efficient handling of player-related information. By incorporating these enhancements, the ServerAPI will emerge as a robust framework for managing diverse gaming scenarios, fostering code maintainability and future scalability. Throughout these changes, the documentation and usage guidelines of the ServerAPI would be updated to reflect the transitions and provide clear instructions on how to interact with the API for different game types, ensuring a smooth and seamless integration of new game functionalities.
