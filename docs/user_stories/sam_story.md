# User Story

This user story is about a 60-year-old man named Doug. Doug is married and a father of two. He is visually impaired. Doug loves to play board games with his kids however, many games are inaccessible for him due to his disability. He has recently begun playing ultimate tictactoe online with his kids. He loves playing the game, but needs help from his kids to log in as well as make moves and understand what is happening on the board at a given time. 

# Feature implementation

This story suggests that an accessibility feature for the visually impaired should be added. This feature would walk a user through the login/registration page as well as explain how to play the game. The feature would also tell the user what cell their mouse is currently on and would also be able to inform a user of the current state of the game board.
