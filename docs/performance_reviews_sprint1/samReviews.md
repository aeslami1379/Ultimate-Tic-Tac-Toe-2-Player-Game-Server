# Team Performance Reviews
### Recorded by: Sam Sheppard

----
## Team Member: Tyler
### Assigned Task: User and Session Management
 - Tyler has been a reliable team member throughout the project
 - His code is well documented but is sometimes a bit on the complex side
 - He has consistently shown up to meetings, and responds timely to contact outside of class
 - Needs to work on communication with regards to asking other team members to provide methods in their modules that will be helpful to his module
 - Made good use of the kanban board and issue tracker

## Team Member: Shreyas
### Assigned Task: HTML Construction
 - Shreyas has been easy to work with throughout sprint 1
 - The main issue that he faced was meeting deadlines, however I believe this was due to the topic being new to him, not lack of effort
 - Good team player, consistantly showed up to meetings and was available outside of class
 - Needs to work on communication, especially with regards to progress updates on his module
 - Made good use of the kanban board and issue tracker

## Team Member: Ashfaq
### Assigned Task: App Logic
 - Ashfaq has become a valuable team member
 - He has provided good solutions to problems encountered throughout the process
 - Was available for the majority of meetings
 - Communication was an issue. There were certain methods he provided that I did not understand their implementation or scope and the explanation provided was not ideal
 - His app_services.py module was a bit of a mystery to me, it was not implemented and I am unsure as to what its future use will be as it contained many methods that seemed to do tasks that were already provided by other modules
 - Made good use of the kanban board and issue tracker

## Team Member: Arshia
### Assigned Task: Server API
 - Arshia has proven to be a hard working team member
 - He has had a lot of difficulties with getting the server API to work however he has clearly put effort into it despite this
 - Was available for the majority of meetings
 - I would have liked for him to ask for help with the server API a little bit earlier in the sprint
 - Made good use of the kanban board and issue tracker

## General Comments
 - The group as a whole made good use of github, the kanban board, and the issue tracker
 - We need a better form of communication. Torwards the end of the sprint we began using discord for some communication, especially for code reviews. This worked well and we will continue to use this in sprint 2
 - Every team member is making an honest effort to pull their weight, something I have not seen before when doing group projects
 - I have enjoyed working with this group and look forward to having more success in sprint 2 and learning from our sprint 1 mistakes
