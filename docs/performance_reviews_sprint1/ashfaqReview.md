# Team Performance Reviews
### Recorded by: Ashfaq 



----
## Team Member: Tyler
### Assigned Task: User and Session Management
He is really doing a good job on his module so far. 
He has been using kanboard and issuer tracker alot lately. 
But communication was a bit issue. 
He doesn't bother to look onto the team members problems when a team mate  runs into an issue.
He was attending meeting regularly and was punctual at team meetings.
He makes sure everything we do is documented.


## Team Member: Shreyas
### Assigned Task: HTML Construction
He had no expereince in webpage devloping when we started this project but he  has learnt alot in this module in very less time.
He doesn't bother to talk to team mates if he runs onto an issue. He was attending most of the meetings.


## Team Member: Sam
### Assigned Task: App Logic
I consider him as a team leader. he really has a good leadership quality.
He is always concern about what the team member are doing.
He regularly checks whats the progress of the project.
He was constantly advicing us to use issue tracker and kanboard when we were discussing the issues in our instagram chat.

## Team Member: Arshia
### Assigned Task: Server API
Though arshia was always pessimitic while we having group meeting. He is always the first team mate to complete his job.
he never fails to meet the deadline.
he Was available for the majority of meetings.
he could have used more  kanban board and issue tracker.

## General Comments
 - The group as a whole made good use of github, the kanban board, and the issue tracker
 - we were only using instagram and classroom session so far but we decided to meet online often .
 - In our last meeting we agreed to have more discord meetings which is more efficent
  because at a point only one person shares the screen and  the whole team focuses one persons work.
 - Every team member is making an honest effort to pull their weight, something I have not seen before when doing group projects.
 - This sprint really made us much closer with the team mates perhaps to put each of our modules together.
 - I personally enjoys this process of working.
 - We been helping out each others module while doing code reviews.
 - overall, the docstring in the modules are much clear.
 - I been writting alot of postive things about my team mates and the progress of the project is because i don't have much complains to write about my team mates.
 - Talking to other group members, i feel like  lucky to get into this crowd.
