# Team Performance Reviews
### Recorded by: Sam Sheppard

----
## Team Member: Tyler
### Assigned Task: User and Session Management
 - Tyler has been a reliable team member throughout the entire project
 - His code is good however, sometimes the format of the return types are a little weird, such as using a string where it might make more sense to use a list
 - Shows up to meetings, and is available for questions regarding his code outside of class
 - His user and session modules were not really implemented until the end. It would have been good to see him add more to these modules to make them more useful
 - Made good use of the kanban board and issue tracker

## Team Member: Shreyas
### Assigned Task: HTML Construction
 - Shreyas has been easy to work with throughout the project
 - He has taken on more workload in sprint 2, but I would like to see him try to help solve some of the more difficult issues we had
 - Good team player, consistantly showed up to meetings and was available outside of class
 - Needs to work on communication with regards to requesting other team members implement a feature for him to use
 - Made good use of the kanban board and issue tracker

## Team Member: Ashfaq
### Assigned Task: App Logic
 - Ashfaq has stepped up greatly in sprint 2 and has solved many of the main technological challenges the team faced throughout sprint 2
 - One issue was that he would solve many issues in one branch, leading to massive code changes in the repository that were difficult for him to explain and for the rest of the team to understand
 - Was available for all sprint 2 meetings
 - Communication was an issue. as mentioned above he needs to be more clear on what he is working on
 - Made good use of the kanban board and issue tracker

## Team Member: Arshia
### Assigned Task: Server API
 - Arshia has worked hard throughout sprint 2
 - His serverAPI module is still very cluttered. He has worked on refactoring it but it is still very difficult to navigate and thus very difficult to work on
 - Was available for all sprint 2 meetings
 - I think he needs to learn how to read and understand documentation better so he could make better use of the bottle library
 - Made good use of the kanban board and issue tracker

## General Comments
 - The group as a whole made good use of github, the kanban board, and the issue tracker
 - The use of discord this sprint greatly improved our communication skills, leading to many meetings outside of class and a lot more progress made compared to sprint 2
 - I don't think that we implemented this project in the best way possible however, I believe that if we as a group were to tackle a similar project with the knowledge we have now, we would have success
