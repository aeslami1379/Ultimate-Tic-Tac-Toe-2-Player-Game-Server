# HTML Module

The HTML module would have to undergo refactoring to extract game-independent components, ensuring reusability across multiple games. Standardized interfaces would need to be introduced to facilitate the integration of new games, defining methods for generating game-specific content and handling user interactions. The proposed architecture would have to separate game-specific logic from HTML generation, allowing for easy integration of new games without modifying existing code extensively. Detailed diagrams would illustrate the revised architecture, emphasizing the modular design and clear separation of concerns. A comparison would highlight the advantages of the DocGameFrame framework over the existing Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe-specific architecture in terms of flexibility and scalability. Diagrams would visually demonstrate the differences between the two architectures, emphasizing the abstraction of game-specific details in the proposed framework. Developers would be provided with clear instructions on integrating new games into the framework, including guidelines for implementing game-specific logic and defining HTML templates. The framework would emphasize the importance of decoupling between HTML generation and game logic, enabling seamless integration of new games while minimizing code modifications.

The DocGameFrame framework proposal presents a structured method to boost the adaptability of the HTML module to support a variety of web-based games. Through refactoring the current codebase and adopting modular design principles, the framework guarantees scalability and straightforward integration for forthcoming game expansions. In-depth comparisons, elaborate diagrams, and precise usage guidelines empower developers to utilize the framework proficiently, cultivating a resilient environment for diverse web-based gaming encounters.
