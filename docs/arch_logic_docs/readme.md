# ReadME

App logic was completed in the sprint 1.
I did make a little bit changes accoriding to  the growth of the project such as store empty strings instead of E.
but not alot of changes i made.

## Sprint 2 Progress

During Sprint 2, efforts were primarily directed towards developing other modules, including HTML and serving API. 


## Test Cases

Consequently, minimal alterations were required in test cases and UML diagrams in App logic module.
In my last part of the project i been working on storing the game and saving the game. there was lot of debugging to do and i had to wait until some requested implentation is done by others.
since i couldn't meet the final pull request deadline. whatever is completely working is not merged in the master branch.
My testcases won't be working in the master branch instead it will be working in the branch 103-ashfaq.
In 103-ashfaq branch store game and save game are also working.
