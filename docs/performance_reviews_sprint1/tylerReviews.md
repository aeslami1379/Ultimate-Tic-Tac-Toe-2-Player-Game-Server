## General Comments
 - We work well as a group.
 - We need to stress communication more for sprint 2.
 - Set Code Reviews/Pull Request deadlines earlier in the sprint, so we don't have issues like we did at the end of sprint 1.
 - Maybe consider more meetings outside our assigned class days, as we need to work more cohesively to produce working code.
 - Good use of the kanban board and issue tracker.
