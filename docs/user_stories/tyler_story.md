# User Story  

---
Meet Harold. Harold is a 32-year-old Wendy's employee that loves all things Tic Tac Toe. Our Ultimate Tic Tac Toe Game 
peaks his interest, and he begins telling his co-workers about this exciting new game he has come across. After playing 
the game multiple times, he has a solid understanding of the directions and logic of the game. However, when he introduces
the game to his friends, they have tremendous difficulty grasping the basic understanding of ultimate tic-tac-toe.

# Feature Implementation

---  
The difficulty that arises with new players learning the fundamentals of the game suggests the potential for an alternative
welcome page, providing specific directions and in game scenarios to help grasp the game concept. Along with this directions
page, an alternative "warmup" game mode could be created, where new players play against a set of predetermined moves from
a player, or even AI generated moves. This "warmup" game mode can be replayed as many times as a new player would like,
until they are familiar with the game.
