# User Story

Benjamin is a final year student majoring in  pure mathematics at memorial University. He is very good in numbers. He loves to play many different board games when he is not in school. He loves  poker out of all the board games.
That best thing he loves about poker is confusing other players eventhough his cards are not strong enough. He finds this game less intresting compared to poker.
# Feature Implementation

To make unltimateTicTacToe fascinte him, we could implement a feature to make prediction of the next move of the opposite player and show up in a screen. This would confuse the other players move. Infact statiscally what benjamins believes is true, a prediction makes the other player to alter his move accordingly.
