# App Logic Module Framework for Board Game

## Overview
The app logic module serves as a framework for implementing various board games. Although certain aspects of the module are applicable across different games, many features require customization to fit specific game mechanics.

## Components
1. **State of the Game**
   - Retains the current state of the game, including board positions, player information, and other relevant data.
   - For chess, state includes the positions of all pieces on the board, current player turn, and other game-specific variables.

2. **Players**
   - Tracks information about players participating in the game.
   - Each player is identified by a unique username or ID.

3. **Methods**
   - **getPlayers():** Retrieve information about the players involved in the game.
   - **getGameState():** Obtain the current state of the game.
   - **setGameState():** Update the state of the game based on game progress.
   - **setPlayers():** Modify player information as needed.

## Implementation for Chess
For the game of chess, certain aspects of the framework can be directly applied, while others require customization:

1. **State of the Game**
   - Tracks the positions of all chess pieces on the board.
   - Manages the current player turn and other game-specific variables.

2. **Players**
   - Records information about the two players engaged in the chess match, such as their usernames or IDs.

3. **Methods**
   - **getPlayers():** Returns the usernames of the two players.
   - **getGameState():** Provides the current positions of all chess pieces and other relevant game state information.
   - **setGameState():** Updates the board state after each move.
   - **setPlayers():** Allows for modifications to player information if necessary.

4. **Customizations for Chess**
   - **Next Move:** Determine the validity of moves according to chess rules and update the board accordingly.
   - **Winning Condition:** Check for checkmate or stalemate to determine the winner.
   - **Validating Moves:** Ensure that moves adhere to the rules of chess, considering factors like piece movement, capturing, and special moves (e.g., castling, en passant).

## Conclusion
While the app logic module provides a foundational framework for implementing board games, customization is necessary to accommodate the unique rules and mechanics of each game. By leveraging common functionalities and adapting them to specific game requirements, developers can efficiently create diverse board game experiences.
