## Team Member: Sam
### Assigned Task: Database
 - Sam has continued his role as the unofficial team lead for sprint 2.
 - He provided a lot of knowledge and outside help for issues that other team members where having.
 - He was very quick to implement any code needed for myself or other team members.
 - During his code reviews he was very thorough and explained things well.
 - Made great use of the kanban board and issue tracker.
 - Sometimes communication outside team meetings was difficult. 
 - Overall, played a huge role in what we were able to implement and I enjoyed working with him.

## Team Member: Shreyas
### Assigned Task: HTML Construction
 - Shreyas contributed well throughout sprint 2.
 - Sometimes availability was an issue with scheduling team meetings outside of class.
 - He had a large workload with the constant updating/implementing of new HTML pages, but was able to manage this well.
 - Did a great job of explaining his code during his code reviews, which made it easy to understand.
 - He did use the issue tracker well, although issues for things that required outside help were not always assigned to a specific member.
 - Communication was okay, could have been more vocal sometimes in meetings.
 - Overall, Shreyas definitely put in a solid effort and his contributions were crucial for a working implementation of our project. I enjoyed working with him.

## Team Member: Ashfaq
### Assigned Task: App Logic
 - Ashfaq was our teams saviour in sprint 2.
 - He was able to finish most of the game logic in sprint 1, and when he finished he immediately started helping with HTML and serverAPI.
 - His code was formatted well, and explained well in code reviews, making it easy to understand.
 - He communicated well outside of team meetings, asking for specific backend features to be implemented when needed. 
 - He contributed to the kanban board and issue tracker a lot, and assigned issues to other team members when needed.
 - Sometimes the features that he was asking for were a little unclear, but eventually we were able to work them out.
 - I really enjoyed working with Ashfaq, and would work with him again in the future.

## Team Member: Arshia
### Assigned Task: Server API
 - Arshia was a valuable team member in sprint 2.
 - His serverAPI module was a little confusing and the reasoning behind the implementation of certain things were not explained in detail. However this proved to be the most challenging aspect of our project.
 - He did a great job creating issues and using the kanban board.
 - He showed up to all meetings and contributed to discussion.
 - Sometimes the issues created regarding implementations of features from others, specifically on the backend were a little unclear.
 - Overall, contributed well to the project and enjoyed working with him.

## General Comments
 - The biggest improvement our team seen throughout sprint 2 was with communication.
 - The online meetings, and not just meeting during class time definitely helped with this.
 - We weren't able to implement everything we wanted, but the project overall was improved tremendously throughout this sprint.
 - I really enjoyed working with this group, especially as we progressed throughout the sprints.
 - The workload of some people was a little uneven, but that is bound to happen when the experience of each team member is at a different level.
 - I think everyone tried their best, and that's all you can ask for.
